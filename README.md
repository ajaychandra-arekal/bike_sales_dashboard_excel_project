### Excel Dashboard Project

This project demonstrates how to build a comprehensive dashboard in Excel, ideal for beginners aiming to expand their skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The primary focus is on creating an interactive dashboard using Excel features such as pivot tables, slicers, and basic formatting to make data insights visually accessible.

### Project Overview

The project walks through the process of developing a data dashboard using a dataset about bike buyers, analyzing customer demographics and purchase behavior. The key objectives are to clean the data, perform analysis, and create a visually appealing, interactive dashboard to explore insights related to customer income, commute distance, age bracket, and purchase likelihood.

### Key Steps

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Imported and removed duplicates from the dataset to ensure data integrity.
- Used the Find and Replace function to expand abbreviated fields (e.g., converting “M” to “Married” and “S” to “Single”).
- Created new fields, such as “Age Brackets,” to categorize age data for more insightful analysis.

Pivot Table Creation:
- Developed pivot tables to calculate average income by gender and bike purchase status, count customers by commute distance, and visualize purchase behavior by age bracket.
- Used Nested IF functions to create age categories, making data more readable in visualizations.

Dashboard and Visualization:
- Designed interactive charts, including bar, column, and line charts, to show customer insights on income, commute distance, and age brackets.
- Set up slicers for filtering data by marital status, region, and education level, enhancing user interactivity and usability.

Design and Formatting:
- Removed grid lines, added a header, and used color themes to improve dashboard appearance.
- Used alignment and sizing to ensure a professional and organized layout, suitable for portfolio presentation.

### Impact and Usage

This project is a practical example of data analysis and visualization in Excel, providing a foundation for further customization and complexity. It offers some Excel proficiency and understanding of key data analysis concepts.
